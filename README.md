# License Plate Reader for Patrol Vehicle Alert System (PVAS)

A 2024-2025 Capstone project in conjunction with the Polk County Sheriff's Office to develop and test a comprehensive Artificial Intelligence based alert system to aid deputies in doing their jobs. The system has been split into three respective subsystems, each with their own functionality and dedicated purpose with the goal of sending different information to the corresponding officer.

# Subsystems:
  - License Plate Reader: Leveraging real-time video stream to automatically read license plate text and compare to existing records in case of any stolen vehicles/hotplates.
  - Gunshot Detection: Utilizing real-time audio streams to classify whether or not a gunshot has been fired in the area/closeby, alerting the officer if so.
  - Approaching Object Detection: Implementing various computer vision techniques to track and identify objects approaching the deputy vehicle in real-time, enhancing the officer's awareness.
